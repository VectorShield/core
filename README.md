# **VectorShield: Advanced Spam Detection with a Vector Database** 
![VectorShield Logo](./logo.png)

VectorShield is an advanced spam detection tool designed to complement existing spam scanners by leveraging vector databases and machine learning to detect **similar patterns in spam emails**. Traditional spam detection engines often miss subtle patterns that are easy for humans to spot but difficult for rule-based scanners. VectorShield addresses this challenge by analyzing email content and identifying **similar emails** based on vector representations.

This tool is intended to **run in addition to existing spam scanners** and improve spam detection accuracy over time by learning from user feedback on which emails are correctly or incorrectly classified.

---

## **Features**
- **Vector-based Email Analysis**: Uses a vector database to find emails with similar content, detecting spam patterns effectively.  
- **API for Real-Time Integration**: Offers a REST API for inserting, analyzing, and managing emails.  
- **False Positive Handling**: An API endpoint to remove mistakenly classified emails from the phishing database, allowing continuous improvement.  
- **Self-Improving System**: Continuously learns from new emails to enhance its detection accuracy over time.

## **Dataset Tools**
The **`dataset/` folder** contains scripts to **download the dataset, import emails into the vector database, and test the current model**.

### **1. Downloading the Dataset**
To download the **Enron Fraud Email Dataset**, run:
```bash
python dataset/download-enron_data_fraud_labeled.py
```
#### **What this does:**
- prints you the following
```bash
please go to https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/advaithsrao/enron-fraud-email-dataset?select=enron_data_fraud_labeled.csv

and downlaod the file, unzip it and place the CSV file within the dataset folder
```

---

### **2. Importing the Dataset into the Vector Database**
After downloading, **import the dataset** into **Qdrant** (the vector database) using:
```bash
python dataset/import-enron_data_fraud_labeled.py
```
#### **What this does:**
- Reads the CSV file (`enron_data_fraud_labeled.csv`).
- Converts emails into **vector embeddings**.
- Inserts them into the **Qdrant vector database** using the `/insert` API.
- Tracks progress in **`dataset/progress.txt`** to resume from the last inserted record in case of failure.

---

### **3. Testing the Current Model**
Once the dataset is imported, **test the phishing detection accuracy** using:
```bash
python dataset/test-enron_data_fraud_labeled.py
```
#### **What this does:**
- Selects **5,000 random emails** from the dataset.
- Sends them to the `/analyze` API.
- Compares the predicted phishing scores with the actual labels.
- Prints **accuracy, false positives, and false negatives**.

At the end of the test, youâ€™ll see a **report like this**:
```
ðŸ“Š Test Summary:
Total Emails Tested: 5000
Total Spam Emails Tested: 2500
Total Ham Emails Tested: 2500
Correct Classifications: 4782
False Positives: 105 (2.1%)
False Negatives: 113 (2.3%)
Overall Accuracy: 95.64%
```
This allows you to **evaluate the model performance** and **fine-tune the classification thresholds**.

## **API Documentation**

### **1. Insert Email**  
**Endpoint:** `POST /insert`  
Inserts a new email into the vector database with a classification (`phishing` or `legitimate`).

#### **Request Example:**
```json
{
  "subject": "Important Security Update",
  "body": "VGhpcyBpcyBhIHNhbXBsZSBlbWFpbCBib2R5Lg==",
  "sender": "security@example.com",
  "type": "phishing"
}
```

- **`subject`**: Subject of the email.  
- **`body`**: Base64-encoded email body.  
- **`sender`**: Email sender address.  
- **`type`**: Email type (`phishing` or `legitimate`).  

#### **Response Example:**
```json
{
  "message": "âœ… Stored phishing email: Important Security Update"
}
```

---

### **2. Analyze Email**  
**Endpoint:** `POST /analyze`  
Analyzes an email and returns a **phishing probability score** with explanations.

#### **Request Example:**
```json
{
  "subject": "Congratulations! You've won a prize!",
  "body": "VGhpcyBpcyBhIGZha2UgZW1haWwgYm9keS4=",
  "sender": "prizes@example.com"
}
```

#### **Response Example:**
```json
{
  "phishing_score": 85,
  "confidence_level": "High",
  "closest_match": "phishing",
  "reasons": [
    "Similar to known phishing email: Prize Notification",
    "Similar to known phishing email: Win a Free Gift!"
  ]
}
```

- **`phishing_score`**: Probability that the email is phishing (0â€“100%).  
- **`confidence_level`**: Low, Medium, or High.  
- **`closest_match`**: Label of the closest matching email.  
- **`reasons`**: List of similar emails and reasons for the classification.

---

### **3. Remove False Positives**  
**Endpoint:** `POST /report_false_positive`  
Removes an incorrectly flagged email from the phishing database.

#### **Request Example:**
```json
{
  "subject": "Meeting Reminder",
  "body": "VGhpcyBpcyBhIG1lZXRpbmcgcmVtaW5kZXIu",
  "sender": "noreply@example.com"
}
```

#### **Response Example:**
```json
{
  "message": "âœ… Removed false positive email: Meeting Reminder"
}
```

---

## **How It Works**
1. **Email Insertion**: Every email is vectorized using a sentence-transformer model and stored in a **Qdrant vector database**.
2. **Similarity Search**: When an email is analyzed, the system searches for similar emails in the vector database and calculates a phishing probability based on known classifications.
3. **Continuous Learning**: The system improves its accuracy over time by integrating feedback on false positives and legitimate emails.
